        <p>The Polish hip hop scene was born in the early 1990s, due to the popularity of American rap. Nevertheless, rap style in Polish music has its deep roots in the 1980s Polish punk rock, alternative rock, disco and funk music.<br>The most recognizablepolish hip hop band abroad is probably <strong>WWO</strong>, which is no longer active since 2006. Sokół (who is also the owner of the <em>Prosto Label</em> and the <em>Prosto Wear Company</em>) since then recorded 3 albums with Pono and 1 with Marysia Starosta (who is also Sokół's fiancee).<br> Jędker abandoned the Polish rap scene to make dance music with Robert M as Monopol (for which he is mocked and disrespected by the present Polish rap scene and most of the listeners) and DJ Deszczu Strugi is an owner of Otra Barwa Studio. Polish hip-hop artists are well-known performers across Europe, especially in the former Eastern Bloc. Many rappers from Poland are collaborating with artists from Europe, the USA
        and even Cuba.</p>
